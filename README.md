HTML Structure
To create a clear and accessible website I used html semantic elements. The header consists of the main naviagtion and each section is for a different area of gardening. The sections contains a Home, About Gardening, Gardening Tips, Gallery, Video, and Contact section.

Styling
I chose a green and white color scheme to reflect the natural theme of gardening. The external CSS file ensures consistency across the site. 

Content
The content includes informative sections about gardening, a tips list, and a themed table. Images, a video, and a contact form enhance user interaction.

The website was built with the HTML structure and external CSS for styling. Using semantic elements like "< nav >,< header >,< footer , and < section > makes the website more accessible and organized. Keeping the CSS file separte allowed for me to easily update and change styles without having it affect the html structutre. The navigation menu makes it easy to access different sections of the website. Dividing the content into sections allows the users to find the information they need faster. The contact form is there for users to able to ask any questions or concerns about gardening. The youtube video that is embedded gives starting tips on how to begin gardening and what to do and not do. The image was inserted to show what can be made by the user if they start gardening. The green and white color scheme matches the colours you would see while gardening and looks good visually.
